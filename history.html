          Neemuch was a British cantonment and later became the birthplace of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in 1939.

        <p>
          Neemuch was carved out from Mandsaur in 1998 to become its own district. It has since grown with modern infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and green initiatives that reflect its name — “A City of Nature.”
